# MyRNNsearch

Project: Neural Machine Translation

This project concerns itself with a Natural Language Processing ("NLP") system which is able to translate a given piece of text from one language into another. It is part of the examination in the lecture on "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" of the M. Sc. Cognitive Systems at the University of Potsdam.

The project is based on the paper:

  	 Bahdanau, Cho & Bengio. Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate. ICLR 2015.

The task is to implement the RNNsearch-50 system, i.e., the encoder-decoder with attention system  for any language pair different from English-German, German-English, English-French, and French-English.
